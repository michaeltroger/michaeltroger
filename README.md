### Hi 👋, I'm Michael Troger, Android Developer!
I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at [adidas Runtastic](https://www.runtastic.com), where I work on Adidas apps as well as on in-house libraries. I have a Master's degree in Mobile Computing and I'm an expert on the Android platform. I have however also a broad unterstanding of web technologies. I have several years of experience in international Scrum teams. In course of my studies, different jobs and freetime projects I was able to gain experience in a broad field of IT and media. To name some examples I engaged with things like computer hardware consulting, frontend and backend web development, game development, computer graphics and computer vision, machine learning, graphic design, photography and augmented reality. While I have a basic knowledge of media design, my strength and interests clearly lie in the technical field.

I was lucky to try many more technologies (e.g. JavaScript, C#, C++, Unity, Python, Scala, Node.js, HTML) in different projects, but the technologies above I'm currently most confident with. From my experience a good developer can handle learning a new programming language or tool rather quickly since the concepts are mostly similar.
